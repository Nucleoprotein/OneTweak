/***** string_var API *****************************
*
* string_var is NVSE's string pseudo-datatype. Strings are represented internally by
* integer IDs, however the details of the implementation are opaque to scripts and
* ideally to plugins as well.
*
* Plugin authors should rely primarily on Assign() to return a string as the result of a script function.
* It takes the COMMAND_ARGS passed to the script function followed by a pointer to the new string.
* i.e. Assign(PASS_COMMAND_ARGS, "some string") assigns "some string" to the  string variable on the lefthand
* side of the script assignment statement, initializing the variable if necessary. Generates a logged error if 
* the scripter does not provide a variable in which to store the result.
*
* GetString(), CreateString(), and SetString() are slightly lower-level functions; use them only if you have a 
* genuine need to directly create and manipulate new string variables outside of script commands. CreateString()
* returns the integer ID of the newly-created string var.
*
* If you want your script commands to support NVSE's %z format specifier (for inserting the contents of a string_var
* into another string), you must pass an NVSEStringVarInterface pointer to Register(). This only needs to be called
* once, preferably during plugin load.

/**** Messaging API docs ********************************************************************
 *
 *	Messaging API allows inter-plugin communication at run-time. A plugin may register
 *	one callback for each plugin from which it wishes to receive messages, specifying
 *	the sender by name in the call to RegisterListener(). RegisterListener returns false
 *	if the specified plugin is not loaded, true otherwise. Any messages dispatched by
 *	the specified plugin will then be forwarded to the listener as they occur. Passing NULL as 
 *	the sender registers the calling plugin as a listener to every loaded plugin.
 *
 *	Messages may be dispatched via Dispatch() to either a specific listener (specified
 *	by name) or to all listeners (with NULL passed as the receiver). The contents and format of
 *	messageData are left up to the sender, and the receiver is responsible for casting the message
 *	to the expected type. If no plugins are registered as listeners for the sender, 
 *	Dispatch() returns false, otherwise it returns true.
 *
 *	Calling RegisterListener() or Dispatch() during plugin load is not advised as the requested plugin
 *	may not yet be loaded at that point. Instead, if you wish to register as a listener or dispatch a
 *	message immediately after plugin load, use RegisterListener() during load to register to receive
 *	messages from OBSE (sender name: "OBSE"). You will then receive a message from OBSE once 
 *	all plugins have been loaded, at which point it is safe to establish communications between
 *	plugins.
 *
 *	Some plugin authors may wish to use strings instead of integers to denote message type. In
 *	that case the receiver can pass the address of the string as an integer and require the receiver
 *	to cast it back to a char* on receipt.

*	used to alter the command table in memory. It probably needn't be said, but
*	doing so would be a Very Bad Idea.
*
*	GetRequiredNVSEVersion returns the minimum major release of NVSE required by
*	the specified command, i.e. the release in which it first appeared.
*	For non-NVSE commands, returns 0. For plugin commands, returns -1.

/**** serialization API docs ***************************************************
 *	
 *	The serialization API adds a separate save data file plugins can use to save
 *	data along with a game save. It is be stored separately from the main save
 *	(.ess) file to prevent any potential compatibility issues. The actual
 *	implementation is opaqe, so it can be changed if needed, but the APIs
 *	provided will always remain the same and will operate the same way.
 *	
 *	Each plugin that has registered the proper callbacks will be able to write
 *	typed and versioned records in to the file, similarly to the way Fallout
 *	.esp files work. Chunk types are just simple 32-bit values, you can use
 *	them for whatever you want as they are only meaningful to your code.
 *	Multiple records of the same type can be added, and records will be
 *	returned to you in the order they were originally written. Versioning is
 *	important so you can update the format of your data without breaking
 *	people's save files. Note that this means that if you have created multiple
 *	versions of a record you will have to check the version number and do some
 *	data conversion on load. Of course it isn't strictly /mandatory/ that you do
 *	this, but I consider not breaking people's save files to be very important.
 *	Also, note that your record data will be uniquely identified by your
 *	assigned opcode base, so make sure that is set up correctly (you really
 *	have to be doing that anyway, but I thought I'd mention it again).
 *	
 *	At any point, a plugin can call the
 *	NVSEStorageInterface::SetSave/Load/NewGameCallback functions to register a
 *	callback that will be run when a game is being saved, loaded, or started
 *	fresh. You must provide the PluginHandle you were given during your startup
 *	function so the core code knows which plugin to associate with the callback.
 *	
 *	When the save callback is called, there are two APIs you can use to write
 *	your records. WriteRecord is the simplest API - just give it your record
 *	type, the version, and a buffer storing your data. This is good when you can
 *	write your entire record all at one time. If you have more complex needs,
 *	use the OpenRecord/WriteRecordData APIs. When starting to write a new
 *	record, call OpenRecord, passing in the record type and version. Then call
 *	WriteRecordData as many times as needed to fill in the data for the record.
 *	To start the next record, just call OpenRecord again. Calling OpenRecord or
 *	exiting your save callback will automatically close the record and perform
 *	behind-the-scenes cleanup.
 *	
 *	The load callback is simpler. First call GetNextRecordInfo. It will move to
 *	the next record (or the first record if it is the first time it has been
 *	called) and return information about it. GetNextRecordInfo returns true if
 *	it found a "next" record for your plugin, so you know you are done reading
 *	when it returns false. After calling GetNextRecordInfo, call ReadRecordData
 *	to retrieve the data stored in the record. It may be called multiple times,
 *	and returns the number of bytes read from the record (really only useful if
 *	you accidentally try to read off the end of the record).
 *	
 *	The new game callback should be used to reset all of your internal data
 *	structures. It is called when a new game is started or a game is loaded with
 *	no save file.
 *	
 *	RefIDs stored in this file involve one complication. The upper 8 bits of the
 *	ID store the index of the mod that "owns" the form. This index may change in
 *	between save and load if a user changes their mod list. To fix this, run the
 *	ID through the ResolveRefID API. It fixes up the ID to reflect any changes
 *	in the mod list. If the mod owning that ID is no longer loaded, the function
 *	returns false.

/**** plugin API docs **********************************************************
 *	
 *	IMPORTANT: Before releasing a plugin, you MUST contact the NVSE team at the
 *	contact addresses listed in nvse_readme.txt to register a range of opcodes.
 *	This is required to prevent conflicts between multiple plugins, as each
 *	command must be assigned a unique opcode.
 *	
 *	The base API is pretty simple. Create a project based on the
 *	nvse_plugin_example project included with the NVSE source code, then define
 *	and export these functions:
 *	
 *	bool NVSEPlugin_Query(const NVSEInterface * nvse, PluginInfo * info)
 *	
 *	This primary purposes of this function are to fill out the PluginInfo
 *	structure, and to perform basic version checks based on the info in the
 *	NVSEInterface structure. Return false if your plugin is incompatible with
 *	the version of NVSE or Fallout passed in, otherwise return true. In either
 *	case, fill out the PluginInfo structure.
 *	
 *	If the plugin is being loaded in the context of the editor, isEditor will be
 *	non-zero, editorVersion will contain the current editor version, and
 *	falloutVersion will be zero. In this case you can probably just return
 *	true, however if you have multiple DLLs implementing the same behavior, for
 *	example one for each version of Fallout, only one of them should return
 *	true.
 *	
 *	The PluginInfo fields should be filled out as follows:
 *	- infoVersion should be set to PluginInfo::kInfoVersion
 *	- name should be a pointer to a null-terminated string uniquely identifying
 *	  your plugin, it will be used in the plugin querying API
 *	- version is only used by the plugin query API, and will be returned to
 *	  scripts requesting the current version of your plugin
 *	
 *	bool NVSEPlugin_Load(const NVSEInterface * nvse)
 *	
 *	In this function, use the SetOpcodeBase callback in NVSEInterface to set the
 *	opcode base to your assigned value, then use RegisterCommand to register all
 *	of your commands. NVSE will fix up your CommandInfo structure when loaded
 *	in the context of the editor, and will fill in any NULL callbacks with their
 *	default values, so don't worry about having a unique 'execute' callback for
 *	the editor, and don't provide a 'parse' callback unless you're actually
 *	overriding the default behavior. The opcode field will also be automatically
 *	updated with the next opcode in the sequence started by SetOpcodeBase.
 *	
 *	At this time, or at any point forward you can call the QueryInterface
 *	callback to retrieve an interface structure for the base services provided
 *	by the NVSE core.
 *	
 *	You may optionally return false from this function to unload your plugin,
 *	but make sure that you DO NOT register any commands if you do.
 *	
 *	Note that all structure versions are backwards-compatible, so you only need
 *	to check against the latest version that you need. New fields will be only
 *	added to the end, and all old fields will remain compatible with their
 *	previous implementations.
